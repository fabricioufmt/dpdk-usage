In this experiment, the setup shown in 'ex01.pdf' was created using Virtualbox.

All VMs interfaces were set to DPDK driver using 'fabricio-setup.sh' script to each VM.

The 'intnet' and 'intnet1' are used to distinguished two differents networks.

Both Sender and Receiver use PktGen-DPDK to send and receive packets into network through your DPDK interface, configuration files are loaded into PktGen commandline to configure: number of packets to send, size of packet, destination ethernet address, etc. The command 'start 0' starts to send the packets through port 0 (index to express DPDK interface on VM).

The Middlebox executes 'ex01.c' and your main function are:
- When received packets through 'port' interface, it changes both source and address ethernet address to send through 'port ^ 1' interface. [0 -> 1 || 1 -> 0]
- The return values from rte_eth_tx_burst and rte_eth_rx_burst are incremented to (t0, t1) and (r0, r1) variables, respectively, each variable to each interface.
- When captured the either SIGTERM or SIGINT signal, the 'signal_handler' function was called and then the r0, r1, t0, and t1 variable values are printed.
